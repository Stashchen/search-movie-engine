To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.", "imdb_rating": "6.7"}}, {"model": "api.movies", "pk": "tt0002504", "fields": {"genre": "Drama, Short", "director": "Lawrence Marston", "title": "The Star of Bethlehem", "description": "Three wise men from the East follow a star to Bethlehem in search of the infant Jesus.", "imdb_rating": "4.8"}}, {"model": "api.movies", "pk": "tt0004637", "fields": {"genre": "Comedy, Short", "director": "George Nichols", "title": "The Star Boarder", "description": "Charlie stays at a boarding-house, where he is the landlady's favorite.

During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.", "imdb_rating": "2.7"}}, {"model": "api.movies", "pk": "tt0820490", "fields": {"genre": "Short, Comedy, Sci-Fi", "director": "Ryan K.

Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, José Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, José, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, Inês Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and Inês fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and Inês do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, Inês' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/Inês relationship being fraught with life long problems.

Jake's world turns upside down when all that could go wrong ... does. Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York.

In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face.

Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans.
